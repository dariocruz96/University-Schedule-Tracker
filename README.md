# University-Schedule-Tracker
Web App to track a person's University schedule

A web app where I can:
- Add my courses (names, code, credits)
- Define class schedules (day, time, location)
- Add assessments (exame dates, assignments, due dates)
- View everything in a weekly calendar or list view

This project is primarily aimed at learning and practicing web application development (frontend, backend, and database) while building a functional tool and have fun!

My starting idea is to use some tools I'm confortable with:
-Frontend (HTML+JS for start and then implement React).
-Backend (Node.js/Express).
-Database (SQLite or Postgres).

# Requirements

## Must Have

-Ability to add, edit, and delete courses (name, code, credits).
-Ability to add, edit, and delete class schedules (day, time, location, linked to a course).
-Ability to add, edit, and delete assessments (exam, assignment, project deadlines).
-Display schedules in a weekly calendar view.
-Display assessments in a list view (sorted by due date).
-Persistent storage in a database (not just in memory).

## Should Have

-Simple authentication (single user login with email/password).
-Responsive web design (usable on desktop & mobile).
-Basic search/filter for courses and assessments.
-Could Have (Future Extensions)
-Notifications/reminders for upcoming assessments.
-Integration with Google Calendar or iCal export.
-Grade tracking (add grades to assessments & calculate GPA).
-Dark mode / user customization of UI.

## Wonâ€™t Have (for MVP)

-Multi-user support (sharing, group schedules).
-Advanced analytics (e.g., workload prediction, semester performance).
-AI/ML recommendations.
